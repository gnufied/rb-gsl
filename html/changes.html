<h1><a name="Title:" href="#Title:">Title:</a> <a name="label-0">["Changes since Ruby/GSL 1.10.3"]</a></h1><!-- RDLabel: "Changes since Ruby/GSL 1.10.3" -->

<p>Ruby/GSL 1.11.2 introduced enhancements and some important bug fixes since the
earlier 1.10.3 release.  Some of the enhancements and bug fixes involve changes
that are not backwards compatible.  Existing scripts that work with Ruby/GSL
1.10.3 may break under 1.11.2 (or later) if they use certain constructs that
are no longer supported or have changed in an incompatible way.</p>
<p>The changes that could break old scripts are described below.  They are
followed by highlights of the other enhancements and new features.</p>
<p>A complete log of changes since Ruby/GSL version 1.10.3 can be obtained by
using Subversion's log command to look at the repository...</p>

<h2><a name="1" href="#1">1</a> <a name="label-1">["Changes that could break existing scripts"]</a></h2><!-- RDLabel: "Changes that could break existing scripts" -->

<ul>
<li>FFT interface has been extensively changed.</li>
<li>Matrix#get has been modified.</li>
<li>Size changing methods of GSL::Vector et al have, in general, been removed.</li>
<li>The #shift, #unshift, #push, and #pop methods have been removed from
  GSL::Vector et al since they result increasing the size of <var>self</var>.  This
  can cause new memory to be allocated and old memory to be freed, but because
  existing Views contain pointers to the old memory, this cannot be allowed.
  Also removed #up and #down aliases from GSL::Poly.</li>
<li>The #concat method of GSL::Vector et al has been changed to always return a
  new, longer instance rather than reallocating memory for <var>self</var>.</li>
<li>Return values from #delete, #delete_at, and #delete_if now follow same
  convention as similarly named methods in Ruby's Array class.  These methods
  should be considered deprecated because existing Views could still refer to
  now unmanged (but still allocated) memory.</li>
<li>GSL::Complex objects are now immutable.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="2" href="#2">2</a> <a name="label-2">["Highlights of enhancements and other new features"]</a></h2><!-- RDLabel: "Highlights of enhancements and other new features" -->

<ul>
<li>Now distributed and installable as a Ruby Gem.</li>
<li>Allow nil for real and/or imag in GSL::Vector::Complex#set(i,re,im) to NOT
  set that component.  For example, "z=GSL::Vector::Complex[1]; z[0] = [nil,
  1]" will set z[0] to GSL::Complex[0,1].</li>
<li>Added GSL::Vector::Complex#to_s method.</li>
<li>Improved GSL::Vector::Complex#inspect.</li>
<li>Added GSL::Vector::Complex#set_real and GSL::Vector::Complex#set_imag methods
  (and real=, re=, imag=, im= aliases).  Currently only work with Numerics, but
  could be made to work with GSL::Vectors (and Arrays of Floats).</li>
<li>Added GSL::Vector::Complex#conjugate and GSL::Vector::Complex#conjugate!
  methods along with corresponding "conj" and "conj!" aliases.</li>
<li>Added "#add!", "#sub!", "#mul!", and "#div!" methods to GSL::Vector::Complex.
  Also "add_constant!", and "scale!" aliases.</li>
<li>Added the following stats methods to GSL::Vector::Complex, #sum, #mean, #tss,
  #tss_m, #variance, #variance_m, #variance_fm, #sd, #sd_m, and #sd_fm.  #sum
  and #mean return GSL::Complex; all others return Float.</li>
<li>Added "dup" alias for "clone" method of Vector and Maxtrix.</li>
<li>Added support for three parameter call to #subvector to support stride.</li>
<li>Added #shape method with alias #size for Matrix.</li>
<li>Provide GSL_Object#dup method to override Object#dup.  GSL_Object#dup simply
  raises NotImplementedError.  Subclasses that want dup functionality should
  provide their own implementation.</li>
<li>Added length alias to Vector and Vector::Complex.</li>
<li>Added #angle alias for #arg method of Complex, Vector::Complex, and
  Matrix::Complex</li>
<li>Added #conj alias for #conjugate for GSL::Complex.  Added #conjugate! method
  with #conj! alias for GSL::Complex.</li>
<li>Added #[]= alias for #set method, #conj alias for #conjugate method, and
  #conj! alias for #conjugate! method to GSL::Matrix::Complex</li>
<li>Support GSL::Permutation as parameter to Vector::Complex#get (and #[]).</li>
<li>Disallow the stride and length parameters of the various FFT methods.  The
  Vector being transformed could really be a Vector::View (e.g. a view of a
  Matrix column).  In that case, we need to use the stride of the Vector::View.
  Users wishing to use a custom stride or length will be able to do so by
  transforming  a subvector of the Vector.</li>
<li>Added Block#length alias for Block#size.</li>
<li>Fixed bug #16023.</li>
<li>Calling #to_v on a single column matrix view will return column vector.
  Related to #19757.</li>
<li>Provided GSL::Matrix::Complex with reasonable #to_s and #inspect
  implementations.</li>
<li>Made Vector#{add,sub,mul,div}! methods work with non-Vector parameter (i.e.
  constant).</li>
<li>Added #collect and #collect! methods to Matrix::Complex.</li>
<li>Added #map and #map! aliases for collect and collect! to Block, Vector et al,
  and Matrix et al.</li>
<li>Vector::Complex#each, #reverse_each, #collect, and #collect! now yield
  objects that are allocated on heap rather than stack.</li>
<li>Made Vector#subvector work with negative offsets</li>
<li>Added Vector#sgn and Matrix#sgn, both with #signum alias.</li>
<li>Added support for a Range parameter (with optional stride) to
  Vector#subvector and Vector::Complex#subvector.</li>
<li>Modified Vector#get and Vector::Complex#get to return Views (via #subvector)
  if more than one (or none) parameters are given or if a single Range
  parameter is given.</li>
<li>Enhanced Matrix#submatrix with many new options and updated docs to reflect
  changes</li>
<li>Modified Matrix#get to use new Matrix#submatrix functionality.</li>
<li>Added Matrix#to_a and Matrix::Complex#to_a methods.</li>
<li>Enhanced Vector#set functionality.</li>
<li>Added more details, examples, and a warning to Vector#set documentation.</li>
<li>Changed Range handling to support Floats for begin and end values where
  appropriate.</li>
<li>Changed Vector#view_with_stride to require non-zero stride rather then
  positive stride.</li>
<li>Enhanced Vector::Complex#set functionality.</li>
<li>Enhanced Matrix#set.  Changed behavior of Matrix#get when called with a
  single Fixnum argument; now returns individual element rather than
  Vector::View of row.  See html/matrix.html for more details.  Changed tests
  and examples to accomdate the change in Matrix#get.</li>
<li>Match to the latest tensor extension (version 0.99)</li>
<li>Modified GSL::Matrix::Complex#set to have same (i.e. newly enhanced)
  functionality as GSL::Matrix#set.  [Possibly incomplete; please report any
  discrepancies.]</li>
<li>Added #diag alias for Matrix#diagonal.</li>
<li>Added #fftshift, #fftshift!, #ifftshift, and #ifftshift!  methods to
  GSL::Vector::Complex and documented them.</li>
</ul>
